# CapstoneOne Backend

This backend provides the secure authentication, user-management, and audit APIs for the CapstoneOne platform. It is built with Java 17, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL, Flyway, Resilience4j, and OpenAPI/Swagger support.

The service is designed for a production-style internal application flow with:

- public signup and login
- role-based authorization (`USER`, `ADMIN`, `AUDITOR`)
- JWT access tokens and refresh-token rotation
- server-side session tracking and logout/revocation support
- administrative user creation and deletion rules
- audit log exposure with least-privilege database read permissions
- rate limiting and database circuit-breaker protection

## Project goals

The backend enforces security at the application boundary instead of trusting UI state. It validates inputs, normalizes usernames/emails, stores only hashed passwords, persists sessions in PostgreSQL, rotates refresh tokens, and logs security-relevant events to a separate audit store.

## Technology stack

- Java 17
- Maven
- Spring Boot
- Spring Web MVC
- Spring Security
- Spring Data JPA / Hibernate
- PostgreSQL

## Runtime architecture

The application uses two separate data paths:

1. Main application datasource
   - stores users and session metadata
   - managed by the application role
   - contains `users` and `auth_sessions`

2. Audit datasource
   - stores read-only operational audit records
   - separated writer and reader credentials
   - provisioned by DBA-managed scripts instead of the app login

## Security model

### Authentication and sessions

The backend issues signed JWT access and refresh tokens. Access tokens are short-lived and intended for API bearer authentication. Refresh tokens are stored as a server-side hash plus session metadata and are rotated during refresh to prevent replay and stale-token reuse.

Authentication flow:

1. `POST /signup` creates a normal `USER` account.
2. `POST /login` verifies credentials and account state.
3. The server returns an access JWT and sets a secure refresh cookie.
4. `JwtAuthenticationFilter` validates each bearer token.
5. The session row is checked to ensure it is active and the token IDs match.
6. The current user role and enabled/locked state are loaded before authorization is applied.

### Authorization rules

- `USER` and `ADMIN` can access their own profile details.
- `ADMIN` can list users, inspect them, create users, and delete users.
- `AUDITOR` can read paginated audit logs only.
- Unmatched routes are denied by default.
- Password hashes and tokens are never returned in API payloads.

### Security hardening features

- BCrypt password hashing
- Jakarta Bean Validation on inbound DTOs
- duplicate username/email checks
- correlation IDs for logs and error tracing
- refresh-token rotation and revocation
- per-user and per-IP rate limits
- database circuit breakers
- least-privilege audit storage access

## Environment configuration

The backend reads environment variables from `.env` via Spring config import.

Example `.env`:

```dotenv
DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/capstone_one
DB_USERNAME=capstone_app
DB_PASSWORD=your-local-db-password

AUDIT_DB_WRITER_USERNAME=capstone_audit_writer
AUDIT_DB_WRITER_PASSWORD=your-audit-writer-password
AUDIT_DB_READER_USERNAME=capstone_audit_reader
AUDIT_DB_READER_PASSWORD=your-audit-reader-password

JWT_SECRET=replace-with-a-long-random-secret
JWT_EXPIRATION=30000
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRATION=60000000

FRONTEND_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000
AUTH_REFRESH_COOKIE_SECURE=true
AUTH_REFRESH_COOKIE_SAME_SITE=Lax
```

Notes:

- `JWT_SECRET` must be strong and stored in secret management in deployment.
- `DB_URL` is usually PostgreSQL on `localhost:5432` for local work.
- `FRONTEND_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` must match the frontend origin used in the browser.
- `AUTH_REFRESH_COOKIE_SECURE` should stay `true` in production unless local HTTP testing is required.

## Database setup and Flyway

The application uses PostgreSQL with Flyway-managed schema updates.

### Main application database

The main database is initialized and maintained by a DBA or local admin. Example local setup:

```sql
CREATE ROLE capstone_app LOGIN;
\password capstone_app
CREATE DATABASE capstone_one OWNER capstone_app;
```

Then grant the required privileges on `public` and the application tables. The application login is not a superuser.

Flyway ensures the schema is checked and migrations are applied on startup. Hibernate is configured with:

```yaml
jpa:
  hibernate:
    ddl-auto: validate
```

This means the app validates schema compatibility instead of auto-generating or modifying database tables.

### Audit database

The audit database is provisioned separately with DBA scripts under `src/main/resources/db`. Those scripts create restricted writer and reader accounts, define the audit table, and configure retention policies.

A separate writer account inserts approved audit columns, while the reader account only selects a safe subset of data. This keeps the audit pipeline isolated from standard application privileges.

## Endpoints

| Method | Route | Access | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/signup` | Anonymous | Create a new `USER` account |
| `POST` | `/login` | Public | Validate credentials and issue tokens |
| `POST` | `/refresh` | Public with valid refresh cookie | Rotate and renew session |
| `POST` | `/logout` | Authenticated | Revoke current session |
| `GET` | `/auth` | `USER`, `ADMIN` | Validate identity |
| `GET` | `/users/me` | `USER`, `ADMIN` | View own safe account summary |
| `GET` | `/users` | `ADMIN` | List users |
| `GET` | `/users/{id}` | `ADMIN` | Inspect a user |
| `POST` | `/users` | `ADMIN` | Create `USER`, `ADMIN`, or `AUDITOR` |
| `DELETE` | `/users/{id}` | `ADMIN` | Delete user and revoke sessions |
| `GET` | `/audit/logs` | `AUDITOR` | Read paginated audit records |

## Request examples

### Signup

```http
POST /signup
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "jdoe",
  "email": "jdoe@example.com",
  "password": "Str0ngPass!"
}
```

### Login

```http
POST /login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "jdoe",
  "password": "Str0ngPass!"
}
```

### Refresh

```http
POST /refresh
Origin: http://localhost:3000
Cookie: refresh=...;
```

### Swagger docs

When the app is running, OpenAPI docs are available at:

- `/swagger-ui.html`
- `/v3/api-docs`

## Error handling and tracing

The API returns structured JSON errors with fields such as:

- timestamp
- status
- error
- message
- path
- correlationId

The application supports a `X-Correlation-ID` request header. If a UUID is supplied, it is preserved; otherwise, one is generated. This helps correlate logs and client-reported issues with server-side operations.

Common statuses:

- `400` invalid input or malformed request
- `401` missing or invalid auth
- `403` insufficient role or forbidden action
- `404` resource not found
- `409` duplicate user or rejected account operation
- `429` rate limit exceeded
- `503` database unavailable or breaker open
- `500` unexpected server error

## Rate limiting

The backend uses Resilience4j with local Caffeine-backed caches for in-memory rate limiting.

Default limits:

- login by username: 5 per minute
- login by client IP: 30 per minute
- authenticated requests by user: 120 per minute
- authenticated requests by IP: 300 per minute
- sensitive routes (`/users/**`, `/audit/**`): 30 per minute per user

These are instance-local limits and do not coordinate across multiple servers. In multi-instance deployments, enforce limits at a gateway or use a shared distributed rate-limit store.

## Circuit breakers

Two circuit breakers are configured:

- `authenticationDatabase`
- `auditLogDatabase`

They protect the app from repeated database failures and temporarily stop calling a dependency when it is unhealthy. Failures are tracked with a sliding window and an open-state delay before the system probes again.

## Running the backend locally

Prerequisites:

- Java 17+
- PostgreSQL running locally
- Maven wrapper (`mvnw`) is included

Setup:

```bash
cd CapstoneOne/backend
cp .env.example .env
# fill in .env values for DB, audit DB, and JWT secret
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The API runs on the default Spring Boot port:

- http://localhost:8080

## Testing

Run the backend test suite:

```bash
cd CapstoneOne/backend
./mvnw test
```

The project uses H2-backed test configurations where appropriate, but PostgreSQL-specific checks such as role grants, retention triggers, and audit privileges should still be verified against a disposable PostgreSQL environment before production deployment.

## Operational guidance

- Store secrets in environment variables or a real secret manager.
- Do not log raw passwords, JWTs, secret keys, or request bodies.
- Use HTTPS and a trusted proxy configuration in production.
- Keep at least one active administrator account at all times.
- Do not modify existing Flyway migration files after they are applied.
- Use new migrations for schema evolution in shared environments.
